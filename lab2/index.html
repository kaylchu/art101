				<h1>Hello World</h1>
	
				<p>We're Jehmiel and Kyle and we are both 3rd years AGPM majors. We met last spring in another mutual class and partner up for this lab.
					 Little bit about Jehmiel, he's Filipino and is from Southern California and like to eat Pho. Kyle is a junior in AGPM and is taking this class because of his elective for his major.
					 He is originally from Southern California too but came here for school because of the campus. He has little coding experience but is confident that he can pick things up pretty quickly due to his
					 experience with computers and technology. </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>There were not many challenges for this assignment except for the css part of it. We had trouble with the . and # for the class and id.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem that we had for this lab was trying to figure out how to change the font of a text with css. We were stumped because we forgot that we needed to use a # instead of a . for an id.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'd say the assignment went pretty well. We worked really well together to solve problems and figure out what went wrong. Everything went pretty smoothly because it was one of our first labs so it probably would be easy to complete. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The result was creating the Lab 2 page, writing out hello world, and writing out the paragraph on the lab 2 page.</p>
