			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that sorts a user input and returns it onto the page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The major problem that I had with this lab was making the return value show up on my page. The reason it was not showing up was not becuase of the javascript, but the HTML code. I needed to create another div for the output section instead of just adding a header. Such a simple solution for a problem that had me in shambles.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
                    <p>The results of this lab is what you are looking at! You can see that the thing that you inputted into the prompt is sorted by alphabetical order!</p>
